Neutral++ xcursor theme
=======================

It is based on Neutral (and jaguarx) theme. Changes:
- left_ptr_watch changed (looks almost per-pixel like in Neutral Plus theme)
- watch is the same as left_ptr_watch
- d&d cursors are replaced by more 'standard' cursors (e.g. dnd-copy replaced by copy etc.)
- window resizing cursors are unified (i.e. double arrows everywhere)
- circle taken from jaguarx theme (only the circle by the arrow, not the whole cursor, since the shadow differs)
- crossed_circle replaced by circle
- for all arrows and pencil hotspots have been moved to the very tip (top-left-most white pixel)
- removed dot anomaly on bottom border of hand cursor
- duplicates have mostly been symlinked instead of copied
- added symlinks for missing kde-specific cursors
- added blank cursor (kde-specific)
- build script improved and cleaned up

Changed files:
- left_ptr_watch*
- circle.png
- all arrow-related *.in files (hotspot): circle.in, copy.in, left_ptr.in, link.in, move.in, question_arrow.in, right_ptr.in
- pencil.in (hotspot)
- hand.*
- index.theme
- added blank.*
- many other files copied/renamed/deleted

ChangeLog:
- 1.0.1: added top_side, bottom_side, left_side and right_side
- 1.0.2: dnd-none symlinked to left_ptr, dnd-ask added
- 1.0.3: Multiple symlinks added/adjusted, fixed .theme file

Compiling:
Go to source subdirectory and run ./make.sh script.
